    <h1>What is this about?</h1>
    <p>The waifbase is where all the memes created by the community live.</p>

    <p>Take the ones you like, upload the ones you create</p>

    <h1>You cannot delete files here</h1>

    <p>That's right! Be careful what you upload to the waifbase, it will live here forever.</p>

    <p>(or you can ask the admins on discord to remove a mistake)</p>

    <h1>Why do I need Waif to use the Waifbase?</h1>

    <p>Only true Waif holders can use the waifbase, you need 10,000 Waif to be able to login. This is to avoid malicious users and spam.</p>

    <h1>How do I log out?</h1>

    <p>Simply disconect your metamask wallet.</p>
