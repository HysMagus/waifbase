## Description

Proof of concept dapp where only Waifu holders can log into our special applications. You need to hold 10,000 Waifus to be able to use this service. It does not charge you waifus, you just need to have them availible in your wallet.

You can upload and download all the waifu related memes. Do not upload things you don't want to share online! The dapp isn't designed to allow users to delete content.
